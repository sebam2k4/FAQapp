# FAQapp

This is a simple app that allows the user to add and remove Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Once a question and answer is saved, they will appear in a new panel with the answer being hidden by default. The user can then toggle the visiblity of the answer by clicking on appropriate button.

The app is using **Local Storage** to save the user data locally within the browser. This means the data will persist when the user refreshes the window and even closes and reopens the browser. It was build using **Angular5** and styled with **Bootstrap 4** and some custom CSS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
