    <p>This is a simple app that allows the user to add and remove Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Once a question and answer is saved, they will appear in new a panel above with the answer being hidden by default. The user can then toggle the visiblity of the answer by clicking on appropriate button.</p>
